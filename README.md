# CSC 4480 Final Project: Power Hour Conference Database

The goal of our project was to create a made up conference of 8 college basketball teams, each of which will have 10 players on their roster. Each player will have their individual career statistics recorded, which consists of points, rebounds, assists, and career field goal percentage.
